Use the Factory Method pattern when

- A class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.
- A class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
- Classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want the localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.
